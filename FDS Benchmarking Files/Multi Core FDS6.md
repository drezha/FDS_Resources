This table sets out the speed of the tested CPU's with FDS 6 and the
[scale1.fds](https://raw.github.com/drezha/FDS_Resources/master/FDS%20Benchmarking%20Files/scale1.fds) file.

FDS 6 is the latest version of FDS, and whilst not yet out of beta, is available for users to test. The software has a number of changes to it's code and the equations it uses. This has the downside of seeing computation time increasing. This page sets out CPU times for the benchmark cases, using the latest Beta.

The table is sorted with speed in descending order.
