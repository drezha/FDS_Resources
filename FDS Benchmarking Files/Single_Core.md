This table sets out the speed of the tested CPU's with FDS 6 and the
[bench1.fds](https://raw.github.com/drezha/FDS_Resources/master/FDS%20Benchmarking%20Files/bench1.fds) file.

The benchmarks were run using FDS 6.0.1. There may be slight differences between this and other FDS versions, however, this gives a starting point. This is intended to be a guide only and models may include features that increase modelling time not shown here - therefore this should be used as a guide only.

The table is sorted with speed in descending order.

|CPU Manufacturer|CPU Name|Elapsed Wall Clock Time (secs)|Speed (Ghz)|Cores|RAM (GB)|OS|32 Bit/64 Bit|Total CPU Time (min)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Intel|Xeon X5660|504.504|2.8|6|24|Windows 7|64|8.24|
